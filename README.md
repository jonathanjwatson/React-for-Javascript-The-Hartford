# React for Javascript - The Hartford

Welcome to React for Javascript! My name is Jonathan Watson and I'll be your instructor. 

This course is designed to provide JavaScript developers with the essential knowledge necessary to build UI components with React.

## Pre-Class Installation Requirements

This course assumes several installations: 

### 1. Visual Studio Code

This is the preferred IDE for the class. We will be using several VS Code extensions that will speed up our learning experiences. 

### 2. Node

[NodeJS] (https://nodejs.org/en/) is essential for our programming material. It includes [NPM (Node Package Manager)] (https://www.npmjs.com/) and will allow us to run [Create React App] (https://create-react-app.dev/)

To check your currently installed version of node, run the following command in your terminal: 

```
node -v
```

To check your currently installed version of npm, run the following command in your terminal: 

```
npm -v
```

I will be running the LTS version (currently at 18.14.1 at time of writing), but lower LTS (even-numbered) versions are okay as well. 

### 3. Create React App

[Create React App] (https://create-react-app.dev/) is a scaffolding tool that will allow us to quickly setup a basic react application. Per the instructions on their ["Get Started"] (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) page, you'll need the ability to run the following command: 

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Where {my-app} is the name of the application you want to create. I **strongly** suggest you run this command prior to the start of class. 

Note: You may receive this when running the above command: 

```
Need to install the following packages:
  create-react-app@5.0.1
Ok to proceed? (y)
```

Type "y". The installation should occur, then create-react-app or (CRA) will continue to run. A successful installation should see a screen something like this:

### 4. GitHub Account and Git

This repo can be found on GitHub. I will be updating the repo throughout the course with additional resources, course material, and solutions. You will need to clone the repo and pull frequently to get access. 

### 5. Chrome Browser

A recent study found that Chrome has 77% of the browser market share globally [kinsta] (https://kinsta.com/browser-market-share/#:~:text=Google%20Chrome%20is%20the%20most,desktop%20web%20browser%20by%20far.). As such, Chrome is the easiest browser to develop for. 

Additionally, it will allow us to install some very helpful extensions (see number six below).

### 6. React Developer Tools

This is a chrome extension that we will be using to view props, state, and context. [Install here] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)

## Class Expectations

Since the Covid pandemic, classroom expectations have changed significantly with the move to online learning. In order to most easily facilitate this medium, I ask the following of my students: 

1. I ask that cameras remain on during in-class instruction time. There are always exceptions: family distractions, needing to step away to use the restroom or answer a phone call, etc. But the best in-class experiences happen when we are able to see and engage with one another. 

2. I ask that students use the Zoom hand-raise feature and wait to be called on to ask questions. Everyone has different internet with different speeds. This avoid talking over one another and gives your fellow classmates the respect they deserve. 

3. We will be taking 10-15 minute breaks throughout the day and a 30-45 minute lunch period around 12:00PM (ET) - 1:00PM (ET) (exact schedule is flexible based on our lesson progress). 

4. In-class activities will be frequent and will use Zoom breakout rooms. As professional adult learners, I am giving you the option of working together in groups or by yourself, though I strongly encourage groups for a more collaborative learning environment. During these times, you may turn your cameras off if necessary.
