# React for Javascript - The Hartford

Welcome to React for Javascript! My name is Jonathan Watson and I'll be your instructor. 

This course is designed to provide JavaScript developers with the essential knowledge necessary to build UI components with React.

## Pre-Class Installation Requirements

This course assumes several installations: 

### 1. Visual Studio Code

This is the preferred IDE for the class. We will be using several VS Code extensions that will speed up our learning experiences. 

### 2. Node

[NodeJS] (https://nodejs.org/en/) is essential for our programming material. It includes [NPM (Node Package Manager)] (https://www.npmjs.com/) and will allow us to run [Create React App] (https://create-react-app.dev/)

```
node -v
```
